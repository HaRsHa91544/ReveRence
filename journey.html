    <h2 class="main">Our Journey</h2>
    <p class="m2">Embarking on a journey in the pharmaceutical industry is a unique and impactful experience. From Research and Development to Regulatory Affairs and Compliance and Manufacturing and Quality Control, Marketing and product launch and Post-Marketing Surveillance, each phase in the industry requires High dedication and Huge specialized skills. </p>
    <p class="m2">The journey in the pharmaceutical industry is challenging but rewarding, with a significant impact on global health. This career path allows individuals to innovate, address complex health issues, and bring lifesaving therapies to patients around the world.</p>
    <h3 class="he" >1. Marketing and Launch</h3 >
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Product Launch Strategy : </span>Teams prepare to introduce the drug to healthcare providers and patients, often involving detailed market analysis, strategic planning, and training for sales teams.</pre>
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Patient Education and Access :</span> Access programs ensure the medication reaches those who need it, while education initiatives help patients understand the benefits and risks of their new therapy.</pre>
    <h3 class="he">2. Pharmacovigilance and Post-Marketing Surveillance</h3 >
    <pre class="m2"><span>•</span> Once a drug is on the market, continuous monitoring is essential to track any adverse events or side effects that might emerge over time. This feedback loop helps improve the safety of future drugs.</pre>
    <h3 class="he">3. Research and Development (R&D)</h3 >
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Discovery Phase :</span> This is where the search for new drugs begins. Scientists work on identifying promising compounds and understanding the disease target.</pre>
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Preclinical Testing :</span> Before human trials, potential drugs undergo extensive laboratory testing to evaluate safety, efficacy, and dosage levels.</pre>
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Clinical Trials :</span> Clinical trials have three main phases, each with specific goals and increasing numbers of participants, aiming to test the safety, efficacy, and side effects.</pre>
    <h3 class="he">4. Regulatory Affairs and Compliance</h3 >
    <pre class="m2"><span>• </span>Regulatory affairs play a critical role in ensuring that drugs meet the rigorous standards set by government health agencies like the FDA, EMA, or WHO.</pre>
    <pre class="m2"><span>• </span>Experts in this field work to compile data, submit new drug applications, and maintain compliance throughout the product's lifecycle.</pre>
    <h3 class="he">5. Manufacturing and Quality Control</h3 >
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Manufacturing Process : </span>Once a drug passes clinical trials, it moves to large-scale production. Facilities must meet Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure consistency and safety.</pre>
    <pre class="m2"><span>• Quality Assurance and Quality Control :</span> Each batch of drugs undergoes strict testing to confirm it meets the established standards.</pre>
        <pre class="m2"><span>•</span> QA/QC is essential for preventing recalls and ensuring patient safety.</pre>
