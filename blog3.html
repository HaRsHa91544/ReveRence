            Female rugby players join the Laborex Senegal teams!
        </p>
        <p>
            On 12 September 2023, Laborex Senegal and the CFAO Solidarité foundation signed an agreement with the Senegalese Rugby Federation. The agreement will enable players in the women’s national team to train as delivery drivers with the Training Centre for Port and Logistics Professions (CFMPL). This will help to meet the subsidiary’s need for workers, promote gender equality internally, and provide these young players with new skills.
            <!–more–>
            Laborex Senegal is expecting five drivers to retire between 2023 and 2027, so the subsidiary is keen to promote gender diversity in its workforce. “While the women’s national rugby team was looking for a sponsor, we came up with the idea of offering them a partnership that would enable us to replace our five retirees with players from the team. It was a win-win situation for both parties, and our idea was immediately accepted by the President of the Federation!”, says a delighted Thomas Crabett, General Manager of Laborex Senegal.
        </p>
        <h2>Deserving young women</h2>
        <p>
            Every year, the CFAO Solidarité foundation subsidises the most innovative projects of its subsidiaries. Thanks to its partnership proposal, Laborex Senegal was named the overall winner. “Five candidates from the national rugby team were submitted to us, and we chose two of them. After one month’s training, they passed the Highway Code exam, obtained their driving licences and signed their first fixed-term contracts with Laborex Senegal”, explains Omar Diome, Director of Human Resources at Laborex Senegal. “The strength and fighting spirit of these young women are impressive! In Senegal, women are often better drivers than men. With this project, we’re proud to be meeting our labour needs in the best possible way”, Thomas Crabett adds.
        </p>
        <h2>Offering new skills</h2>
        <p>
            After three months’ training alongside designated delivery drivers, the players will be fully operational. “Placed in pairs with trainers selected for their profile, they will benefit from their experience and understanding. So far, their integration has gone very well,” explains Omar Diome. Aged between 20 and 25, they are not stopping their sporting activities. The management of Laborex Senegal even plans to take its teams to one of their matches! By 2024, a further three players should be able to benefit from this training and join the Laborex Senegal teams.
